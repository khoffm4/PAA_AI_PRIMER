# AI/ML Workshop for Population Research

## Welcome!

This repository contains all materials for the workshop "Machine Learning and AI for Population Research: Tools, Applications, and Implications." Here you'll find slide decks, exercises, and solution code.

## Workshop Overview

This hands-on workshop bridges the gap between modern AI/ML techniques and the unique challenges of population research. As traditional data collection methods face increasing constraints, researchers are turning to machine learning approachesâ€”but these tools weren't originally designed with population studies in mind.

Through interactive R-based exercises, participants will gain practical experience with AI/ML methods while critically examining their implications for population research.
