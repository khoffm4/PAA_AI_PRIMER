## Introduction

When implementing regression with LASSO regularization, collinearity between predictors can significantly impact model performance in several ways:

1. Producing biased coefficient estimates
2. Incorrectly selecting variables for exclusion from the model
3. Inflating standard errors

This exercise demonstrates how LASSO, while somewhat effective at addressing these issues under mild collinearity conditions, can exhibit compromised performance under high collinearity scenarios.

## Exercise Objectives

Your task is to implement the following experiment from: *Zhao, P., & Yu, B. (1970, January 1). On model selection consistency of lasso. Journal of Machine Learning Research. http://jmlr.org/papers/v7/zhao06a.html* :

### Data Generation
1. Generate 1,000 samples where X₁, X₂, e, and ε follow a standard normal distribution (μ = 0, σ = 1)
2. Create a collinear variable X₃ using the formula:
   
   X₃ = (2/3)X₁ + (2/3)X₂ + (1/3)e
   
   *Note: The standard deviation of e controls the degree of collinearity. Higher values reduce collinearity, while lower values increase it.*

3. Calculate the correlation coefficients between X₁, X₂, and X₃ to quantify the collinearity.

### Model Construction
4. Create a response variable Y using the formula:
   
   Y = 2X₁ + 3X₂ + ε
   
   *Note: The true coefficients are β₁ = 2, β₂ = 3, and β₃ = 0 (X₃ is not related to Y). Ideally, LASSO should identify X₂ as the most significant predictor, X₁ as secondary, and X₃ as spuriously correlated.*

### Analysis
5. Using the provided template file (`LASSO_example.R`), regress Y on X₁, X₂, and X₃ and analyze the LASSO path.
   - Compare the LASSO estimates to the true coefficients (β₁ = 2, β₂ = 3, β₃ = 0) for models with 3, 2, and 1 parameters
   - Evaluate whether LASSO excluded variables in the correct order

6. Repeat the analysis with varying standard deviations of e to examine how different degrees of collinearity affect LASSO's performance.
   - Determine if increasing or decreasing collinearity brings the LASSO estimates closer to the true values
