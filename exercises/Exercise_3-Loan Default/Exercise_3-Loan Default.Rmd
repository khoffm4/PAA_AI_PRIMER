## Study Design and Algorithmic Bias

The principle "garbage in, garbage out" remains fundamental in data science. This exercise demonstrates how even well-implemented models cannot overcome the limitations of poor-quality dataâ€”a challenge that becomes increasingly significant in our current data landscape.

### Objectives

Our goal is this exercise is to illustrate how flaws in sampling design direct affect model predictions in ways that can perpetuate or amplify existing biases in various algorithmics. 


### Procedure

1. **Data Acquisition**
   
   Download the dataset `Loan_Application_Data_subset.csv`, containing 10,000 randomly selected records from the [2023 FFIEC national loan-level dataset](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-publication/dynamic-national-loan-level-dataset/2023), which encompasses national-level data on all home loans issued in the United States during 2023.

2. **Data Partitioning**
   
   First remove any loans that were not accepted:
   - A loan is denoted as accepted if it has loan_data$action_taken == 1
   
   Divide the dataset into two segments:
   - Training set: First 3,000 loan records
   - Test set: Remaining 1,955 loan records
   
   The training set will be used to develop a deliberately biased model to demonstrate how this bias affects subsequent analysis.
   

3. **Initial Data Analysis**
   
   Before manipulation, examine the dataset using linear regression and the LASSO model provided in `Lending_LASSO.R`. 
   
   -Make a model that predicts loan amount [loan_amount] based on income [income], interest rate [interest_rate], sex [derived_sex], and race [derived_race] of the applicant.
   - Analyze the relationships between these predictor variables and loan amount
   - Compare LASSO results with standard linear regression outputs
  

4. **Creating a Biased Dataset**
   
   To mimic the effect of a biased sample design, create a new dataset from the training data which oversamples low income female. For each datapoints in this biased sample:
   - Include female applicants with less than the median loan amount with 80% probability
   - Include non-female applicants (male, joint, or undisclosed) with 20% probability
   
5. **Model Comparison**
   
   - Fit a linear regression to both the biased and unbiased training dataset.
   - Generate loan amount predictions using the biased and unbiased linear regressions
   - Compare the predictions made using the biased and unbiased linear regressions. Are there any patterns in the errors?
   - Analyze prediction accuracy stratified by applicant demographics and identify whether certain groups receive better or worse estimates
   -If time, repeat the above with LASSO and random Forest
   


6. **Sensitivity Analysis**
   
   Vary the 80/20 probability split used in step 4 to create datasets with different levels of bias:
   - Implement a range of sampling probabilities
   - Assess how varying degrees of sampling bias affect prediction accuracy
   - Determine the threshold at which sampling bias begins to significantly compromise model performance
   - Establish criteria for "reasonable" accuracy and identify the maximum tolerable sampling bias
